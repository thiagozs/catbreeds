# Hostgator challenge

## Stack of tech

Here is a list of stack of tech used in this project

* Golang version 1.14.1 linux/amd64
* Docker CE
* Sqlite3
* Jq
* httpie
* golangci-lint
* Github CI

## Dependencies of project

You need install some libs for running this project.

### Httpie for curl sintact sugar

Linux based on **Debian**, you need first install **httpie**, so you can use `sudo apt install httpie`, and you need a **plugin** for **jwt** request, so you can install with this command `pip3 install -U httpie-jwt-auth`, in my case I'm using python3.

### Jq (JQuery for command line)

On Debin linux, you can install with `sudo apt install jq`

### Swagger API doc

`go get -u github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag`

for update the documentation just run command `cd api/cmd` and after run the swag for find and write a swagger documentation. `swag init -g main.go`

Endpoint for documentation: `http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html`

## Test project

In command line inside folder of project, run `go test ./... -v` or makefile `make test`

## Check lint of code

You need the `golangci-lint`, for the installation I recommend you see the documentation about that. Link for doc [Here](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint)

## Start project

Run `go run api/cmd/main.go` in command line.
Or you can make the binary files using `makefile build`, this command you going generate all binaries(***raw and zip***) files for **linux**, **macOs** and **raspBery Pie** in folder `out`.

## Generate docker image

For create a image with **Docker-CE** just running in folder of projet the command `docker build -t thiagozs/challenge .`

Runing the image after build `sudo docker run --rm --name=challenge --publish=8080:8080 thiagozs/challenge:latest`

## Docker Healthcheck

On the construction of image we have a change to put a little **healtcheck** on API.

```sh
Step 17/17 : HEALTHCHECK --interval=5s --timeout=2s --start-period=2s --retries=5 CMD [ "curl", "--silent", "--fail", "http://localhost:8080/ping" ]
```

## Testing API in easy mode

After started the api, you can acess the endpoint for create/show a **account**, this method you going generate a login with password. At this time you don't need login with a **JWT** token, to create/show. To create your credential follow the steps below.

### Create registry (@usernamea and password)

In your terminal: `http post http://localhost:8080/account username=thiagozs password=123`

```sh

    "UserName": "thiagozs"
}

```

### Login with your @username and get JWT token

In you terminal: `http post http://localhost:8080/login username=thiagozs password=123 | jq -r .token > mytoken.txt`

```sh

Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

## Little atention

Guys, I would like to say that at the time of the covid-19 crisis, right now I really need that position. The startup I'm currently working on is not doing very well. I have a newborn daughter and my payment is the only one in my house. Pick me! Thanks for all =)

Made with love.

**2020, thiagozs**
